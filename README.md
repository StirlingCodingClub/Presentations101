# Presentations101
This is a set of examples of how to make presentations using RStudio, Rmarkdown and in paricular Xaringan.

To install Xaringan, [look here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan-start.html).
An excellent showcase of Xaringan functionality is [available here](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1), made by the [author](https://yihui.name/en/) himself.

RStudio's [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/contact/) has a number of really excellent examples further showing the use and features of Xaringan:  
[Meet Xaringan: making slides in Rmarkdown](https://arm.rbind.io/slides/xaringan.html#1)  
[R-Ladies Presentation Ninja](https://alison.rbind.io/slides/rladies-demo-slides.html#1), with the code available [here](https://github.com/rbind/apreshill/blob/master/static/slides/rladies-demo-slides.Rmd).  

If you do **really** want to make your slides look amazing, it will be well worth your while delving into CSS, at least a little bit. It will give you far more control over the look of your slides.
If you don't know what CSS is, [@rosemckeon](https://github.com/rosemckeon)'s [introductory Coding Club session](https://github.com/StirlingCodingClub/css) is excellent. 
[John Little](https://dukeslides.johnlittle.info/)'s [Duke University template slide deck](https://dukeslides.johnlittle.info/slides/#1), is an excellent example presentation which uses custom CSS to modify slide background colours, add colour text boxes etc. Have a look at their CSS file [here](https://github.com/libjohn/dukeslides/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/xaringan_duke/resources/hygge-duke.css), specifically the .content-boxes.

I also have an example of a lecture on modelling in conservation science, made in Xaringan, [here](https://jejoenje.github.io/ENMPG21_2019/ENMPG21_JM_ModellingIntro.html#1)..
