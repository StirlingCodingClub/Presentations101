class: center, middle

# This is a centered slide with text in the middle.

### And some more text

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# This the same centered slide but with the colours reversed! :-)

---

# We can do all our other tricks with making bullet points...

- Like so
- And so
- And even nested lists work
  - Here you go
  
With **xaringan** it is even easy to do incremental bits on slides, using the -- break instead of triple dashes to split slides.
  
  
--
Like so.
  
  
--
And so.

# Footnotes

Another cool convenience function is footnotes... so you can add bits at the bottom of the slide, like at the bottom of this slide.  

.footnote[
I am a footnote! 
]

In the next slide, you can see how you can have "background images" across the whole slide very easily, and tweak its size etc.

background-image: url("https://live.staticflickr.com/3448/3190416619_d017f9c6a3_z.jpg")
background-position: 50% 25%
background-size: 35%
class: center, bottom, inverse

## A shameless excuse to dig out my old photos...

# More useful (boring) tricks?

```{r,echo=FALSE}
somedata = rnorm(1000, 100, 10)
hist(somedata)
```

---

# Extended useful tricks

.pull-left[
```{r,echo=TRUE}
somedata = rnorm(1000, 100, 10)
hist(somedata)
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r,echo=FALSE}
somedata = rnorm(1000, 100, 10)
hist(somedata)
```
]

---

# After the above, the use of include_graphics may be more interesting...

## Make your plot once; but include it anywhere:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
somemoredata = data.frame(x = rnorm(1000, 0, 1), 
                          y = rpois(1000, 20))
png("someplot.png")
plot(somemoredata$x, somemoredata$y)
dev.off()    
```

---

# And then print the plot on the next slide:

.pull-left[
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("someplot.png")
```
]

.pull-right[
This means you can just repeat the figure where you need it...
]

---

.left-column[
This is some text in the left column
  
This is useful if you want some banner on the left 
]

.right-column[
And here is some on the right
  
And main text on the right

]
